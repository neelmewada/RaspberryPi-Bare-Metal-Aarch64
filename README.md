# RaspberryPi-Bare-Metal-Aarch64
A bare metal program written in Arm64 assembly and C language that runs on a Raspberry PI without any OS.

The goal of this project is just to demonstrate how to write a basic Operating System for Raspberry Pi that can interact with the hardware and display some output via UART serial or an HDMI output.
